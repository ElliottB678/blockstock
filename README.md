What is Timescope?

Timescope is a IOS app that uses the homescreen widgets to show the most relevant time zones 
to you and a 2d model of our solar system displaying where the planets are currently.

Timescope gives you interesting visual data and a different perspective of 
the current time and how we measure time.
