# Timescope

## What is Timescope?

Timescope is a IOS app that uses the homescreen widgets on iphone to show the most relevant time zones 
to you with ease of access instead of needing to open an app. Timescope also displays a 2d model of 
our solar system displaying where the planets are currently located.

Timescope gives you interesting visual data and a different perspective of 
the current time and how we measure time as humans.
